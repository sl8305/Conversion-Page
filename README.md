## Project Status

- Visual - complete

- Functionality - in progress
    -  capture user input 
    -  convert the user input given the units chosen from the dropdown options

## Why:

- I live in a household where different members grew up using different systems of measurements. I wanted to create a central website that would help me convert units and better understand those around me. Not only does this help with weather conversion but it also helps with converting measurements when trying to cook.
